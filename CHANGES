Version 0.5.2

* Upgrade to new EventMachine API to facilitate cleaner initialization of
  connection objects

Version 0.5.1

* Add #score method to peers to compare ideal transfer candidates

* Convert PDTP::Server::ChunkInfo to store chunk data in RangeMaps

* Add daemonization support

Version 0.5.0

* Factor traffic routing code into PDTP::Server::TransferManager

* Cleanup transfer reporting and factor into PDTP::Server::Transfer

* Add bandwidth estimator class and integrate into transfer reporting

* Add bandwidth estimates to the status page with associated helpers

* Eliminate the ClientInfo class and factor all ClientInfo-related code
  into the PDTP::Server::Connection class

Version 0.4.1
* Add -v / --version flags to dsclient and dstream

* Add additional flags to dstream for specifying listen addr / port

* Status page now factored into its own ERb template in status/

* Added Mongrel handlers to serve images/stylesheets for status page

* Added StatusHelper module to provide helpers for status page

* New status page

Version 0.4.0
* Change PDTP::Client#run to take an instance of PDTP::Client::Callbacks rather
  than the name of the class to instantiate

* Register PDTP::Server's Mongrel StatusHandler before the file service handler
  in order to prevent a potential conflict when displaying the status page.

* Client / File Service HttpHandlers now check for knowledge of requested
  URIs and return 404 if an unknown resource is requested

* Client / File Service now properly handle interal exceptions

Version 0.3.0
* dsseed now factored into server.rb.  Remote seeds will not be supported until
  protocol changes can be made to support authenticating remote seeds, remote
  file lookup, and remote hash checking.

* Switch to Kirk Haines' Evented Mongrel and remove all usage of threads from
  the entire application

* Stats page relocated to /stats.  This allows a single mongrel to operate for
  both the file service and for the stats page.

* Remove common_init.rb and any dependency on the @@log and @@config variables

* Add logging facility to the server application to replace @@log.  Similar
  facilities should be added for clients.

* Refactor PDTP::Client and PDTP::Server APIs to support the above changes.

Version 0.2.1
* Switch HTTP client to use an EventMachine-based version, rather than net/http

* Added PDTP.version for retrieving version of the library

Version 0.2.0
* PDTP::Server and PDTP::Client now expose APIs intended for public consumption
  They may change slightly down the road, but will remain largely the same

* PDTP::Client now uses a Tempfile for its internal buffer, drastically 
  improving its memory usage

* The protocol now uses length prefix framing, rather than using CRLF encoding.
  This breaks protocol compatibility with the 0.1.0 release but should represent
  the last major change to the protocol format.

Version 0.1.0
* Initial release
